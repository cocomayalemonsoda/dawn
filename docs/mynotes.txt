Shopify Theme Development - Learning Progress
1. Setting Up the Development Environment
✅ Installed and set up VS Code for Shopify theme development
✅ Forked and cloned the Dawn theme from GitHub
✅ Created a new theme called "playful-pastel" and pushed it to Shopify
✅ Set up Shopify CLI to preview and test themes locally
✅ Practiced using Git for version control

2. Git Commands Learned
git clone <repo_url> → Clone a repository
git add . → Stage all changes for commit
git commit -m "Your commit message" → Commit staged changes
git push origin main → Push committed changes to GitHub
git pull origin main → Pull the latest changes from the main branch
shopify theme push → Upload local theme changes to Shopify

3. Shopify Theme Architecture
✅ Layout (theme.liquid) - The main structure of every page
✅ Templates (.json/.liquid) - Defines the structure of specific pages (home, product, etc.)
✅ Sections (.liquid) - Modular components that templates load
✅ Blocks - Elements inside sections (text, buttons, images)
✅ Theme settings (settings_schema.json) - Controls global theme options like colors and fonts

4. Key Concepts & Notes
Templates load all sections
Sections appear only when their template is called
You can have multiple page templates with different layouts
Blocks are only used inside sections
TL;DR = "Too long; didn't read" (a quick summary of important details)


Pages That Support JSON Templates
You can create .json files for the following page types: ✅ index.json → Homepage
✅ product.json → Product pages
✅ collection.json → Collection pages
✅ cart.json → Cart page
✅ search.json → Search results page
✅ page.json → Regular pages (e.g., About Us, Contact Us)
✅ blog.json → Blog overview
✅ article.json → Individual blog posts

Pages That DO NOT Support JSON (Must Use .liquid)
These pages require .liquid templates:
❌ gift_card.liquid → Gift card pages
❌ password.liquid → Password-protected page (if the store is locked)
❌ checkout.liquid → Checkout page (Only Shopify Plus can modify this)
